\# 🌟 AI Code Optimizer



Transform raw code into \*\*high-performance, production-ready solutions\*\* with \*\*AI-driven automation\*\*.  

Designed for developers, engineers, and interns who aim to \*\*push the boundaries of software efficiency\*\*.



---



\## 🚀 Project Vision



AI Code Optimizer is \*\*more than a tool\*\*—it’s a \*\*revolution in code engineering\*\*:



\- \*\*Analyze \& Measure\*\*: Automatically evaluates cyclomatic complexity and runtime performance.  

\- \*\*Optimize Across Languages\*\*: Python, C, C++, and Java source files are intelligently optimized.  

\- \*\*Professional Reporting\*\*: Generates PDF reports for benchmarking and code quality tracking.  

\- \*\*Focus on Innovation\*\*: Developers spend time on creativity, not debugging inefficiency.



\*\*Outcome:\*\* Industry-level practices + AI integration = perfect showcase for \*\*top-tier internship programs\*\*.

\## 🔥 Why This Project Stands Out



\- \*\*AI-Powered Code Optimization\*\*  

&nbsp; Leverages Google Gemini API for \*\*intelligent, language-aware code enhancements\*\*.  



\- \*\*Multi-Language Support\*\*  

&nbsp; Handles Python, C, C++, and Java with \*\*language-specific corrections\*\* (e.g., Java class naming, execution checks).  



\- \*\*Performance Metrics\*\*  

&nbsp; Tracks complexity, runtime, and speedup to \*\*quantify optimization impact\*\*.  



\- \*\*Professional Reporting\*\*  

&nbsp; Generates \*\*structured PDF reports\*\* for review, presentations, or technical documentation.  



\- \*\*Scalable \& Modular\*\*  

&nbsp; Organized directories for optimized code and reports, ready for \*\*enterprise-scale projects\*\*.  



\- \*\*Real-World Utility\*\*  

&nbsp; Reduces hours of manual optimization, demonstrating \*\*practical engineering thinking\*\*.
